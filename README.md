# Flights Delay Prediction

## Context:
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

## Goal:
The goal is to predict flight delays (ARRIVAL_DELAY).

## Data:

* flights.csv

## Additional Information:
